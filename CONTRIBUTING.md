# How to contribute
The sensu-java-api plugin was written as a wrapper around Sensu functionality for the CommerceHub development team. If your project requires any feature(s) that aren't included feel free
to submit a pull request.

Fork and clone the repo:

    git clone git@github.com:you-username/repo.git

Review the testing instructions in the README.md, and ensure all tests pass.:

    ./gradle(w) test

Make your change, add tests for your change, and make sure all tests still pass:

    ./gradle(w) test

Push to your forked repo and submit your pull request.

To increase the chance of your pull request's acceptance:

* Write tests
* Write detailed commit messages
* Include documentation for any added features
